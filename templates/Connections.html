<p><strong>Biology</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Biology is heavily involved with the processes of the body. Our goal with this project would be to see how the cockroach is affected by the g-forces inflicted during launch and flight. Testing like this provides insight into how organisms are affected by high g-forces while also showing ways to improve the protections put in place to keep the cockroach safer. Comparing the background information on how humans in the past have been affected by g-forces with the findings of the cockroach today can help further our understanding of g-forces on the body. This can be used in things like space travel, air travel, and even in high speed car racing. The more safety precautions can be implemented into transit, the faster it can be taken. But knowing how these systems affect the body is the first priority and something that can be tested with this project.</span></p>

<p><strong>Chemistry</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creation of the rockets used within this experiment are heavily reliant on chemistry for their function. Many rockets utilize chemical reactions to generate thrust, and are therefore reliant on these processes. In designing rockets within this CSP Project, it helps to encourage students forward into the fields of rocket science, pioneering new designs and ideas that will utilize the chemistry shown within this CSP. The goal overall is to replicate different liquid fuel rockets. In order to do this, the students will utilize different chemicals provided to them, such as baking soda and vinegar to produce a large amount of pressure and cause an explosion due to the pressure generated in the process.</span></p>

    <p><strong>Physics</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the context of this project, physics allows us to consider all the possible acting forces and how they can influence the potential outcomes. Building a rocket requires prior in-depth knowledge on principles such as Newton&rsquo;s Laws of Motion, kinematics, aerodynamics, forces like thrust, drag, weight, lift, and most importantly: G-Force. Physics will help us establish concrete numerical values for our experiment, which is important because it will allow us to apply our findings to real world situations. We can figure out how certain measurements of G-Force and other forces affect organic bodies, specifically our own, and use that to build upon our knowledge of air/space travel.</span></p>
